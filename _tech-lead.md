## About RentDrop
We are building the future of rental software for landlords and tenants. This is an opportunity to join a venture-funded company with a proven team as an early engineer. If successful, we will have transformed the way individual landlords and tenants operate; a marketplace that exchanges $500B annually. 

## About the Role
We believe that the future of property rentals is financially empowering tenants and landlords. RentDrop is transforming rental payments, communications, applications, credit reporting, and so much more — and we’re looking for an experienced engineer to join our distributed team as an architect and technical lead.

Reporting directly to the CTO, we are looking someone who loves to get their hands dirty and wear many hats. Someone who has proven experience building a services architecture for scale and who enjoys being a technical mentor to a growing team of engineers.

You will be an integral part of our engineering team - focused on building for scale and advocating for sound technical decisions. The backend team is focused on developing secure, scalable, performant, and thoughtfully designed systems — so prior experience in scaling and creative problem solving are crucial.

In this role, you will design and implement services architecture, design and build APIs, architect scalable data solutions, lead thought and discussion on key technical and architectural decisions, and collaborate to improve and grow the team as a technical mentor. We are a small team, and our engineering culture promotes and encourages contributions from everyone.

- You are a delight to work with and constantly demonstrate humility
- You are excited to be an early employee and relish the challenges therein
- You are an excellent problem solver who can be scrappy
- You are passionate about  improving developer experience
- You are a great team player, focusing on the customer problem and working to design a solution

## Your Experience
- 7+ years building for scale in the cloud
- 7+ years as a true polyglot or as a JS/TS/Node engineer
- Production experience in AWS, Postgres and Docker
- Demonstrated experience implementing best practices in data security (PCI, GDPR, etc.)
- Experience designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines

## Benefits
- Unlimited PTO

- Home office setup allowance of $1,500
