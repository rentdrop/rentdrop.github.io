Welcome to the RentDrop Engineering blog! The team is excited to bring you stories about some of the technical challenges we are solving, and how we think differently about approaches to some common pain points in the real estate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_technology" target="_blank">PropTech</a>) and financial (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology" target="_blank">FinTech</a>) industries.

But first, I want to provide a little context around why I joined RentDrop and why I believe this company is going to do amazing things in an industry that is begging to be disrupted.

## The Team
I am a startup fanatic. Most of my career has been working in and on startups. I am crazy about the energy, speed and problems that startups experience — and I have worked hard to stay in and around the startup community. I have started 3 companies, been through interviews in both <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y-Combinator</a> and <a href="https://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank">TechStars</a>, and even helped exit a company. As a result, I have met many people in the startup world. 

Overall, I would say there are two types of “startup people” — talkers and doers. I won’t touch on “talkers,” as I’m sure we all know how that goes. Within the “doers” category, I’d say there are three types of people:

1. People who are willing to work really hard
2. _Smart_ people who are willing to work really hard
3. _Experienced_, _smart_ people who are willing to work really hard

While each of these has its merits, I think we can all agree that category #3 is the most ideal scenario, given the luxury of choice.

The first time I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/remenokoruwa/" target="_blank">Remen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-keller-24309644/" target="_blank">Ben</a>, it was immediately clear to me that both of them were incredibly intelligent. As we had ongoing conversations about RentDrop and my potential involvement, it didn’t take long for me to identify that these founders both fit squarely into the third category.
