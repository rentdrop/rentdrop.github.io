Welcome to the RentDrop Engineering blog! The team is excited to bring you stories about some of the technical challenges we are solving, and how we think differently about approaches to some common pain points in the real estate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_technology" target="_blank">PropTech</a>) and financial (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology" target="_blank">FinTech</a>) industries.

But first, I want to provide a little context around why I joined RentDrop and why I believe this company is going to do amazing things in an industry that is begging to be disrupted.

## The Team
I am a startup fanatic. Most of my career has been working in and on startups. I am crazy about the energy, speed and problems that startups experience — and I have worked purposefully to stay in and around the startup community. I have started 3 companies, been through interviews in both <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y-Combinator</a> (in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> days) and <a href="https://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank">TechStars</a>, and even helped exit a company. As a result, I have met many people in the startup world. 

When I first spoke with RentDrop’s co-founders, Remen and Ben, I was floored by their focus, intelligence and resolve. The experience and organization they bring to the table is refreshing and motivating. Beyond that, they are genuinely good people who care equally about the success of their employees as they do about the success of RentDrop. They expressed to me their desire to build an engineering team who feels pride in their accomplishments	 and in the software they are building… which is great, because those are exactly the types of teams I love to build!

It was only a matter of time before I would energetically join RentDrop!
