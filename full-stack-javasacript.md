## About Rentdrop
We are building the future of rental software for landlords and tenants. This is an opportunity to join a venture-funded company with a proven team as an early engineer. If successful, we will have transformed the way individual landlords and tenants operate; a marketplace that exchanges $500B annually.

## About the Role
We believe that the future of property rentals is financially empowering tenants and landlords. Rentdrop is transforming rental payments, communications, applications, credit reporting, and so much more — and we’re looking for an experienced engineer to join our distributed team as a Javascript/Typescript engineer with experience NodeJS, React, Redux and React Native.

As a full stack Javascript engineer on our small engineering team, you will be a big part of determining technologies used, design patterns, data models and more. This role is ideal for someone who has extensive experience and understands the pitfalls of poorly thought-out implementations. But as with any startup, execution is vital. We move quickly and expect you to do the same.

## Tech Stack (the fun stuff)
- Typescript
- NX (monorepo)
- Express
- Hapi
- Prisma
- Postgres
- AWS
- CI/CD

## About You
- You _love_ startup life
- You are a delight to work with and constantly demonstrate humility and experience
- You are passionate about impressing customers
- You are excited to be an early employee and relish the challenges therein
- You are an excellent problem solver who can be scrappy

## Your Experience
- 4+ years building APIs in NodeJS (Express, Hapi, Koa, etc.)
- 3+ years building mobile applications (React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Java)
- 1+ years of experience with typescript

## Benefits
- Competitive salary with stock options
- Remote-first culture (we've been doing this long before COVID)
- Unlimited PTO
- A new MacBook Pro
